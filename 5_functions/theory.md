# Functions

- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value. Letâ€™s look at some examples.

- Statements:

```
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

output> The value of y is: 4
```

- Expressions:

```
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

output> The value of y is: 5

```
