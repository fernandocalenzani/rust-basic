# Control Flow

In Rust, you can use the control structure if, else if, and else to control the flow of the program based on boolean conditions. Here's the basic syntax:

- if-else
- Matches

```rust
let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
    Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
    None => println!("There is no third element."),
}

```
